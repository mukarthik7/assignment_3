		<h1>Subscript and Superscript</h1>
		

		<p>Perhaps the most familiar example of subscripts is in chemical formulas. For example, the molecular formula for glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub></p>
		<hr>
		<p>Ordinal indicators are sometimes written as superscripts (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, rather than 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th), although many English-language style guides recommend against this use.</p>
